# Expo Router web drawers example

This example uses [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for web-only layouts that feel more refined to the web platform, and React Navigation drawers on native. The result is better overall bundle size, a11y, and performance on web.

This is a fork of my [expo router shadcn guide](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-shadcn-ui-demo).

> Reminder: Shadcn UI does not work on native, so you'll need to ensure you don't load any Shadcn UI components on native. You can use the `Platform` module to do this. Learn more: [Platform-specific modules](https://docs.expo.dev/router/advanced/platform-specific-modules/).
